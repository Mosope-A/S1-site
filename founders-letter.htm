                                                    can see the New York Stock Exchange, with Fearless Girl just around the
                                                    corner. And as I write this letter to the current and future shareholders of
                                                    BitGo, I can’t help but wonder: how did I get here?

                                                    I certainly never wanted to work on Wall Street. While many of my college classmates went to work
                                                    in finance, my path was different. I was interested in systems, networking, and scalability - I wanted
                                                    to build products. It wasn’t until 2012 that I would learn of Bitcoin, and the two worlds collided for
                                                    me. Like others, Bitcoin inspired me to dig into money - what makes good money, how do our
                                                    markets work, and can we build a better financial system? Suddenly it was clear - financial markets
                                                    were like the Galápagos Islands - prehistoric and basically untouched by modern technology. It
                                                    was time for a change.

                                                    I started my career just as the Web was beginning to unfold, and I joined Netscape before it was a
                                                    household name. There, I witnessed the growth of the Internet Bubble and eventually the dot-com
                                                    crash. Some mock that period as a “peak bubble” but that’s not what it was. That was the natural
                                                    process of markets sorting out winners and losers after a major technology disruptor. And that
                                                    process sorted out some big winners - like Amazon and Google.

                                                            Today, we sit 15 years after another major technology disruptor: Bitcoin and
                                                            blockchains. This time we’re revolutionizing the global financial system. Some
                                                            call that “Web 3.” But this revolution is harder than Web 1.0 because it deals
                                                            with money. And when it comes to money, we at BitGo always hold ourselves
                                                            to a higher bar. In addition to technology, this disruption changes legislation,
                                                            regulation, and power in all countries. We’re currently in the middle of that
                                                            same natural process that followed Web 1.0, and the market is shaking out
                                                            which businesses are valuable and which are not. Many will fail.

                                                    From a traditional finance perspective, many criticize the digital asset industry as “re-
                                                    learning the history of Wall Street.” But we’re not re-learning; we’re re-architecting. Unlike
                                                    the traditional financial system and related regulations that predated digital assets, digital
                                                    asset builders today have the advantage of a pretty simple element: computers. The
                                                    architects of the new financial system will not be financiers looking to make a quick buck,
                                                    they will be experts in fault-tolerance, distributed systems, rules engines, and algorithms.
                                                    When we’re done, global markets won’t be subject to the control of a few large financial
                                                    institutions, but will instead be protected by the immutable mathematics of the many.

                                                In the way that AWS was a pioneer among internet infrastructure
                                                companies, BitGo is a pioneer among digital asset infrastructure
                                                companies. We started with a simple idea in 2013: digital assets
                                                needed secure storage technology. We pioneered the 2-of-3
                                                multi-signature protocol, now the gold standard for securing
                                                Bitcoin. But we didn't stop there

                                        </p>
                                            
                                        <p>
                                            <small><small>
                                                By 2014, we had built a pioneering institutional-grade wallet infrastructure for multi-user
                                                wallet with policy managment. By 2015 we were an innovator in launching a
                                                normalized API securing multiple blockchains, from Bitcoin, to Ethereum to Litecoin and
                                                more. Over time, we expanded to deliver many other innovations, such as the first
                                                commercial implementation of 2-of-3 multi-party-computation(MPC). Technology never
                                                stops evolving-and neither does BitGo

                                                we didn't stop at wallets. As the ecosystem grew, so did the needs. Exchanges needed
                                                reliable custody to back their trading desks. Protocols required staking secure solutions to
                                                reward participants without exposing them to slash risks. Token issuers wanted compliant
                                                infrastruture to launch Stablecoins and real world assets(RWAs). BitGo swiftly
                                                positioned to become the backbone- a foundational layer powering it all. Today, the
                                                BitGoo platform is used to protect over $100 billioon in assets, support more than 1400
                                                digital assets, and facilitate billions in trades. We've custodied assets for gorvernments
                                                like El salvador and Bhutan, powered liquidity for major exchanges, and enabled fintechs
                                                to embed digital assets seamlessly into their apps. We're not just participants; we're
                                                architects of the infrastructure that makes the digital asset economy possible.

                                                And let's be clear: this wasn't luck. it was delibrate design. while others chased retail
                                                hype or speculative trading, we focused on the unsexy but essential: security,
                                                compliance, and scalability. We became one of, if not the first qualified custodians
                                                purpose-built for digital assets, earning SOC 1 and SOC 2 attestations, CCSS audits, and
                                                offering up to $250 million in insurance coverage for digital assets held in qualified
                                                custody. In a space riddled with scandals,BitGo has remained steady,safe, and growing.
                                                That's not arrogance, that's track record forged in the fires of multiple crypto winters.

                                                    across our global footprint, with major regulated operations in the US, Europe, the Middle

                                                    want to know that we are not only operating in a compliant manner for them, but that we

                                                        Since our founding, BitGo has been nothing if not transparent. All of our roles — as a
                                                        software provider, regulated custodian, and financial services provider — require us to be
                                                        completely open about how our technology and processes work along with audits,
                                                        attestations, and more. And in this angle, we, our clients, our regulators and our auditors
                                                        are all aligned: transparency is key.

                                                    As such, the transition of BitGo into the public markets is simply the next evolution
                                                    of this transparency. Digital assets have now taken the center stage in mainstream, traditional
                                                    finance. Most of these traditional finance companies are public, have been so for
                                                    decades and meet the highest standards and the highest bar for their clients. They want
                                                    BitGo to be a public company as they build their own products and rely on BitGo’s
                                                    infrastructure. As such, this transition will help us expand our business and differentiate
                                                    ourselves from our competitors.

                                                        need more standardization, more agreement, and more infrastructure. Fortunately, BitGo
                                                        is at the center of it.

                                                            market is a mere $4 trillion. As RWAs take foot, we believe that trillions
                                                            more will move into the digital realm. BitGo’s job is to enable and
                                                            accelerate this transition. Along the way, we hope to leave a mark, making
                                                            digital assets usable for all.
